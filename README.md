This is a draft to build a Ethereum Virtual Machine on Lightning Network, the layer 2 on Bitcoin.
# Motivation
Using technology from Ethereum and security backed by Bitcoin, we create a EVM with compatibility to Layer 2. Making DeFi on Bitcoin grow and have new products and applications. Nowadays many blockchains are highly centralized like Polygon, where for we create healthy environment of innovation is necessary do this using a blockchain trutly decentralized.
# Abstract
In form of unite Rust and Solidity, we create a new language programming.
